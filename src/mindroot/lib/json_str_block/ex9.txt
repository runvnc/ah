{"think": {"extensive_chain_of_thoughts": "Let me plan out a simple ANSI art demo about cows:\n\n1. Analysis:\n- Need to create a fun, simple ANSI animation/graphic\n- Should include cow-related imagery\n- Can use ASCII/ANSI characters for art\n- Should be visually appealing but not too complex\n\n2. Components needed:\n- Basic cow shape using ASCII characters\n- Some grass/field elements\n- Simple frame\n- ANSI color codes for enhanced visuals\n\n3. Design approach:\n- Will create a pastoral scene with a cow\n- Use green color for grass\n- Brown/white for cow\n- Blue for sky\n- Add some simple details like flowers\n\n4. Technical considerations:\n- Need to use ANSI escape codes for colors\n- Will use basic ASCII characters for shapes\n- Keep it under 80 columns wide for compatibility\n- Make sure the scene is visually balanced\n\n5. Evaluation:\n- Scene should be recognizable\n- Colors should enhance readability\n- Overall composition should be pleasing\n\n6. Implementation plan:\n- Will write the scene to the specified file\n- Include color codes and positioning\n- Add comments for clarity\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'll create a simple but charming cow scene using ANSI art."}},
